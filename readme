# Predictive Analysis for Manufacturing

This project provides a predictive analysis tool for manufacturing machines. The goal is to predict machine downtime based on provided data like temperature and run-time using machine learning.

## Features:
- Upload a CSV file with data for training a machine learning model.
- Train a Logistic Regression model to predict machine downtime.
- Make predictions on new data.

## Setup Instructions:

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `Flask`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`

### Setup:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-analysis-manufacturing.git
    cd predictive-analysis-manufacturing
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

### Testing API Endpoints:
You can test the following API endpoints locally using tools like Postman or curl.

- **Upload Data** (POST request to `/upload`):
    - Upload a CSV file to be used for training the model.

- **Train Model** (POST request to `/train`):
    - After uploading a file, use this endpoint to train the model.

- **Make Prediction** (POST request to `/predict`):
    - Use this endpoint to make predictions on new data.

## Sample Dataset:

A sample dataset `sample_dataset.csv` is included in this repository for testing. The dataset should have columns:
- `Temperature`: Numeric value representing machine temperature.
- `Run_Time`: Numeric value representing machine run-time.
- `Downtime_Flag`: Target variable (0 or 1) indicating whether downtime occurred.

 API Testing:
Once the application is up and running locally, you can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl:

Upload File: POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload with the file attached as form-data (key: file).

Train Model: POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/train after the file is uploaded.

Make Prediction: POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict.
